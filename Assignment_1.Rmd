```{r, echo = FALSE}
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv'
guns_data = read.csv(url)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}

  filter(age <= 65)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}

```

We have data about `r nrow(guns_data)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(guns_data) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below: 

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1) 
```



```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race") 
```
